Optimal bunch size is of the order of nParallel=10^5 photons with a typical Win10 64-bit running on 8 GB RAM.
This number is optimized on my PC (Matlab 202ob on a W10 machine with 8Gb RAM), but please experience other values on your machine

Many bunches are successively and independently generated to build up a statistical ensemble.
