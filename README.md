# MonteCarlo_for_DWS


NB: This is a template script, and you are free to adapt it your needs!

More details on the script, and on its usage, can be found in: Lorusso et al., Advances in Colloids and Interface Science (2021)
It is based on the following literature:
[1] Weitz, Pine, "Diffusing wave spectroscopy", in "Dynamic Light Scattering", Oxford University Press (1993)
[2] Durian Physical Review E 51, 3350 (1995)

Optimal bunch size is of the order of nParallel=10^5 photons with a typical Win10 64-bit running on 8 GB RAM.
This number is optimized on my PC (Matlab 202ob on a W10 machine with 8Gb RAM), but please experience other values on your machine

Many bunches are successively and independently generated to build up a statistical ensemble.
